# DataVisualization-FinalProject
Final Project attempting to predict cancer diagnosis using a large data set and logistic regression whilst visualizing findings.
This project was done as a 4 man group and wouldn't be possible without the contribution of my teamates Mathew Fernandes, Victor Armani, and Osama Jaffery.
The entirety of the project was done in RMarkdown and the data was given to us by our professor.
The HTML file contains the code, the word file contains the detailed paper, and the pptx file contains the presentation.
